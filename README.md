# Blibli-VR

This proposal is to develop a definitive omnichannel commerce solution in Virtual Reality. The user should be able to browse a catalog, inspect products and their details, and receive up-to-date information about the product like price, stock, attributes, etc. They should be able to check out virtually, and using a pre-saved payment method / wallet, they should be able to place an order.

This project's scope and timeline is managed on Notion.
